Recently (during summer holidays of 2025, I have been working on WebDev, namely using flask. As a result I am learning HTML, CSS and utilising Python.
This is my third (and final) project as part of the course.  

The website developed on the course provides a basic website, requiring login to access, that allows a user to add movies (movie name, trailer, actors, rating etc.) and then displays it on their home page.  

I have heavily modified my website to also enable a shared movies feature: i.e. If a movie is on the database, and another user goes to add the same movie (same name) the rest of the details of the movie will be pre-populated for them.
My main reason for this is that I wished to have a 'Featured Movies' display to enable users to quickly add popular new movies, this is still a work in progress.

As this website is login protected, an account needs to be created OR the example email address can be used if you wish to access the website without submitting your personal details.  
EXAMPLE LOGIN: (email and password)

Another notable new feature is the inclusion of a dark mode.

I am hosting the website on render.com
